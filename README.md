# Thought Process
Everyone knows that acquiring a loan is something that requires face to face communication. We thought that if we can move that online we can save the time of both the RBC employees and the client. In addition, it allows for real-time tracking of the loan application. Small business owners already have enough to worry about so if RBC can reduce some stress, it would be greatly appreciated by the client.  

# Concept Description
Small business owners sometimes struggle to get their business started. A major issue is usually that they do not get enough funding to start up. A normal process time for a loan is 6 weeks. The apprehension of waiting and leaving your livelihood in the hands of others is a stress time. 

Our application wants to reduce and possibly even prevent this situation. In our application we will allow for the small business own to see real-time status of their loan application. On top of that, it allows the RBC employees to make a decision on the loan and update it to the customer instantly. 

We also know that first time small businesses will have many questions regarding their investment and will require advice/counseling. We thought of that and so added a live chat system that connects the client with a RBC representative.

# Value to RBC
• This will allow RBC to compete with other fast paced online loan companies such as Borrowell, Mogo, and Lending Loop in a much safer and legal manner

• Will attract clients that like knowing the status of their loans

• Makes getting approved for a loan easier and simpler

• Sets a precedent in moving major bank loan approvals from face to face to online
